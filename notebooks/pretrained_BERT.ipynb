      "sos respected user, hi i evalauted your query thoroughly. sorry to hear about the issue. * prognosis depends on many factors - age - associated comorbid conditions like heart attack / cv stroke / kidney malfunctions / diabetes - immunity - haemoglobin level - body response to treatment - competency of doctors - efficacy of molecules used in treatment & much more list not possible to narrate whole here. * considering all your narrations, her prognosis is guarded, not that much good as normal person suffering from pneumonia recovering in days. - she may take very long time for recovery & may not recover also ( i pray to god that doesn ` t happen ) after your long jugglery with all ventilator period. - i can suggest to see the progress of the patient on ventilator for 5 - 7 days discuss with the consultant in details regarding this & then decide to continue the treatment or wean her off from ventilator for resting her sole in peace. hope this clears your query. thanks for using health care magic & keeping trust in our medical services regards eos\n",
